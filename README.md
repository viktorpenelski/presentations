# Running the presentations

most depend on reveal-md to run, so as a prerequisite:

```
npm install -g reveal-md
```

(the `-g` is optional to globally install it)

From there, run `reveal-md the-markdown-presentation.md`.
Some presentations might also have additional configs like `css` or preferred theme. Check out [orchestrating-ml-devbg\run.sh](orchestrating-ml-devbg\run.sh) as an example.
